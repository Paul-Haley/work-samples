Why Ruby?
Said to try a new language. Looking through the `ping.rb` file, Ruby looked pretty nice. Never having used Ruby, started doing a little reading and experimentation. Can easily say it is one of the most satisfying languages I have used for a while. I am aware this is likely a long way from idiomatic Ruby, would be keen to learn more.  

Assumptions:
It is assumed that the log times POSTed are strictly non-descending.
    I realise that this is a poor assumption.

Data structure:
Hash table used to store LinkedList for each device (device id is key).
    Expected constant time lookup to find the LinkedList
LinkedList is used as an unconstrained number of logs can be made. Finding the time/date range requested is O(n) as a result.

If the data was to be stored persistently, SQLite via Ruby dbi would be a reasonable choice if there was no serious concurrent access going on. I did not implement this due to time limitations (university).
